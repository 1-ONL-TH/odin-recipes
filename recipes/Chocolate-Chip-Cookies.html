        <p>I had a craving for chocolate chip cookies with caramel chunks. All I had on hand for salt was coarse salt and, much to my surprise, the result was delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
            <li>18 unwrapped caramel candies (such as Werther's®), each cut into 6 pieces</li>
        </ul>
          
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <h4>step 1</h4>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Beat brown sugar, butter, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture until blended; beat in vanilla extract. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is just combined; fold in chocolate chips.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Divide dough into thirty six 2 tablespoon-size balls; arrange on a baking sheet. Press 3 caramel pieces into each dough ball.</li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.</li>
          </ol>
